Comparison between human and mouse:
(1) Percentage of identical amino acids is 92.54%
(2) Aligmnet score using BLOSUM62 matrix is 3137

Comparison between human and rat:
(1) Percentage of identical amino acids is 91.75%
(2) Aligmnet score using BLOSUM62 matrix is 3107

Comparison between mouse and rat:
(1) Percentage of identical amino acids is 96.83%
(2) Aligmnet score using BLOSUM62 matrix is 3261


In conclusion, rat and mouse's amino acid sequence are most closely related as their percentage identical and alignment score are the highest among three pairwise combinations. 
Mouse is a better model organism for human as the percentage identical and alignment score between human and mouse are higher than between human and rat
